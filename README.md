# Sigma Internship Coding Challenge

## Overview
This repository presents my solution to the Sigma Wedge Hackathon Analysis, a coding challenge that leverages the Quantrocket platform to develop a minimalist trading model. The challenge is centered around algorithmic trading with the objective of maximizing portfolio value through strategic buy orders. Focusing specifically on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock for the year 2023, the model employs a trading strategy that classifies market states, calculates a Transition Probabilities Matrix, and determines the optimal moments to execute buy orders based on daily stock price movements.

## Getting Started

### Collection of Data
Obtained the closing prices for each trading day within the specified period (January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023). Closing prices are a critical piece of data for financial analysis and trading strategy development, as they represent the final price at which a stock is traded during a trading session

### Visualizations and Analysis
#### Line Chart
This line chart illustrates the daily closing prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock throughout the year 2023. Each point on the chart represents the stock's closing price on a specific date, plotted along the vertical axis, against time on the horizontal axis. The chart provides a visual representation of the stock's performance over the year, highlighting trends, fluctuations, and potential patterns in the stock's price movement.

#### Distribution of Daily Returns
The distribution chart showcases the daily returns of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock throughout 2023. Daily returns are calculated from the stock's closing prices, reflecting the percentage change from one day to the next. This visualization helps in understanding the volatility and risk associated with AAPL stock over the specified period. By examining the spread and skewness of the returns, we can gain insights into the stock's typical behavior - identifying periods of stability versus those of significant price movements.

#### Moving Averages and Close Price
This visualization presents the moving averages alongside the daily closing prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock for the year 2023. Moving averages are calculated for different periods (e.g., 50-day and 200-day) and plotted over the stock's actual closing price to highlight trends and potential points of resistance or support. The daily closing price line provides a direct view of the stock's performance over time, while the moving averages smooth out short-term volatility to reveal underlying trends in the price movement

#### Bollinger Bands
Bollinger Bands are a type of price envelope developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s. They are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. Volatility is based on the standard deviation, which changes as volatility increases and decreases. The bands automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases.
